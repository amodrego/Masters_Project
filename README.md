Final master's project. The software used is PhysiCell where some code additions were done in order to improve the program not only considering oxygen as the substance which determines the cell cycle and metabolism but also glucose, ATP and lactate generated in hypoxia conditions.
Also the Extracelular matrix colagen concentration is considered due to its important role in cell migration.
